 	During the last stages of the pulling a neck-shaped wire connects
 	the two electrodes, the diameter of which is reduced to single atom
 	upon further stretching. For some metals it is even possible to
 	form a chain of individual atoms in this fashion. Although the atomic
 	structure of contacts can be quite complicated, as soon as the weakest
 	point is reduced to just a single atom the complexity is removed.
 	The properties of the contact are then dominantly determined by
 	the nature of this atom. This has allowed for quantitative comparison
 	of theory and experiment for many properties, and atomic contacts
 	have proven to form a rich test-bed for concepts from mesoscopic
 	physics. Properties investigated include multiple Andreev reflection,
 	shot noise, conductance quantization, conductance fluctuations,
 	and dynamical Coulomb blockade. In addition, pronounced quantum
 	effects show up in the mechanical properties of the contacts, as
 	seen in the force and cohesion energy of the nanowires. We review
 	this research, which has been performed mainly during the past decade,
 	and we discuss the results in the context of related developments.}

   abstract = {Recent developments in the rapid sequencing, mapping, and analysis
 	of DNA rely on the specific binding of DNA to specially treated
 	surfaces. We show here that specific binding of DNA via its unmodified
 	extremities can be achieved on a great variety of surfaces by a
 	judicious choice of the pH. On hydrophobic surfaces the best binding
 	efficiency is reached at a pH of approximately 5.5. At that pH a
 	approximately 40-kbp DNA is 10 times more likely to bind by an extremity
 	than by a midsegment. A model is proposed to account for the differential
 	adsorption of the molecule extremities and midsection as a function
 	of pH. The pH-dependent specific binding can be used to align anchored
 	DNA molecules by a receding meniscus, a process called molecular
 	combing. The resulting properties of the combed molecules will be
 	discussed.}

 	In this paper, we calculate the electron transmission probability

 	If the metal-nanotube interface is sufficiently ordered, we find
 	that k-vector conservation plays an important role in determining
 	the coupling, with the physics depending on the area of contact,
 	tube diameter, and chirality. The main results of this paper are
 	(i) conductance scales with contact length, a phenomena that has
 	been observed in experiments; (ii) in the case of uniform coupling
 	between metal and nanotube, the threshold value of the metal Fermi
 	wave vector (below which coupling is insignificant) depends on chirality;

 	models of disorder are considered, weak uniform disorder and isolated
 	strong scatterers. In the case of weak uniform disorder, our simulations
 	show that the conductance is not significantly affected by disorder
 	when the Fermi energy is close to the band center. Further, the
 	transmission around the band center depends on the diameter of these
 	zero band-gap wires. We also find that the calculated small bias
 	conductance as a function of the Fermi energy exhibits a dip when
 	the Fermi energy is close to the second subband minima. In the presence

 	two reservoirs of two-dimensional (2D) electrons. When a weak potential
 	difference is applied to the 2D-electron-gas regions, ballistic
 	transport of electrons occurs within subbands as for a single channel.
 	In addition to the subband transport, we predict that there are
 	sharp resonances associated with bound quantum states located at
 	the intersection of the channels. For longer channels the conductance
 	G associated with this kind of resonant tunneling appears to be
 	quantized as G=2e2N/h, where N=1 or 2. In addition to the peaks
 	in G associated with resonant tunneling, there are also deep ``antiresonances''
 	that severely distort the quantized plateaus in G obtained for a

 	(minima and saddle points) located on these surfaces. A conical
 	intersection is characterized for the first time on the ground-state
 	potential energy surface of all cations. It arises from the crossing
 	of the adiabatic surfaces of the ground and first excited state
 	at planar geometries. A nonplanar minimum is observed for the cytosine
 	cation only. The geometry and electronic changes occurring along
 	these surfaces are analyzed, leading to a comparison between the
 	different nucleobase cations. The study of larger ionized systems
 	related to DNA is rendered possible thanks to the optimized medium
 	size basis set proposed in this work, as exemplified by the calculation
 	of the IP of a stacked dimer of guanines.},

	many weakly coupled nanotubes that each have a different electronic

	to tailor the properties of these composite nanotubes. We can remove
	shells of MWNTs stepwise and individually characterize the different
	shells. By choosing among the shells, we can convert a MWNT into
	either a metallic or a semiconducting conductor, as well as directly
	address the issue of multiple-shell transport. With SWNT ropes,
	similar selectivity allows us to generate entire arrays of nanoscale
	field-effect transistors based solely on the fraction of semiconducting

	Well-defined positions were found at which the nanotube transport

	A self-consistent solution of coupled quantum transport and Poisson's

	thickness needs to be much smaller than the channel length (length
	of the molecule) for the gate control to be effective. Furthermore,
	we show that a rigid molecule with metallic source and drain contacts
	has a temperature independent subthreshold slope much larger than
	60 mV/decade, because the metal-induced gap states in the channel
	prevent it from turning off abruptly. However, this disadvantage
	can be overcome by using semiconductor contacts because of their

	wire sandwiched between two semi-infinite (carbon) nanotube leads
	as a model for nanoelectrodes. Employing the Landauer scattering
	matrix approach, we find that the conductance is very sensitive
	to parameters such as the coupling strength and geometry of the
	contact. The conductance exhibits markedly different behavior in
	the two limiting scenarios of single contact and multiple contacts
	between the molecular wire and the nanotube interfacial atoms. In
	contrast to a single contact, the multiple-contact configuration
	acts as a filter selecting single transport channels. It exhibits
	a scaling law for the conductance as a function of coupling strength
	and tube diameter. We also observe an unusual narrow-to-broad-to-narrow
	behavior of conductance resonances upon decreasing the coupling.}

	representation of Kohn-Sham eigenstates and a superposition of optimized
	neutral-atom potentials and related charge densities for constructing
	the effective many-atom potential, all integrals are calculated
	within DFT. Self-consistency is included at the level of Mulliken
	charges rather than by self-consistently iterating electronic spin
	densities and effective potentials. Excited-state properties are
	accessible within the linear response approach to time-dependent
	(TD) DFT. The coupling of electronic and ionic degrees of freedom
	further allows us to follow the non-adiabatic structure evolution
	via coupled electron-ion molecular dynamics in energetic particle
	collisions and in the presence of ultrashort intense laser pulses.
	We either briefly outline or give references describing examples
	of applications to ground-state and excited-state properties. Addressing
	the scaling problems in size and time generally and for biomolecular
	systems in particular, we describe the implementation of the parallel
	`divide-and-conquer' order-N method with DFTB and the coupling of

  abstract = {DNA molecules are able to transport electrons over long distances.
	In most experiments the process is stimulated by the oxidation of
	guanines (G), which generates guanine radical cations. The electron
	transport through DNA occurs in a multistep hopping mechanism with
	all Gs as carriers of the positive charge. The rate of each individual
	hopping step between the Gs decreases strongly with increase of
	the distance. If the (A:T) bridges between the guanines are long,
	adenines (A) also become charge carriers. Mismatches, single strands,
	and G-oxidation products can drastically diminish the efficiency
	of the charge transport. But in triplexes and DNA/RNA duplexes,
	as well as in several duplex DNA/peptide complexes, the efficacy
	of the charge transport is less affected. The ability of DNA molecules
	to transport charges over long distances could provide a mechanism
	for ameliorating the harmfulness of damage to DNA under the conditions
	of oxidative stress.}

	principles to current research advances. Grosso (University of Pisa)
	and Parravicini (University of Pavia) begin by focusing on the electronic
	structure of crystals--band theory, excitons and plasmons--and lattice
	dynamics. Descriptions of methods used to investigate crystalline
	properties, such as particle scattering, optical spectroscopy and
	transport measurements, then follow. The final chapters are devoted

	OR \\ Kurzbeschreibung \\ Solid State Physics bridges the gap between
	fundamental principles and current research topics. Traditional
	subjects, as well as the most recent advances, are covered in a
	rigorous, but clear, mathematical style. With the only prerequisite
	a working knowledge of wave mechanics, the reader is gently guided
	through the subject and supplied with the tools which will allow
	him or her to explore (without getting lost) the lively world of
	current research. Solid State Physics is set to become the reference
	work in this field.\\ Solid State Physics begins by focusing on
	the electronic structure of crystals (band theory, excitons and
	plasmons) and lattice dynamics. Descriptions of the methods used
	to investigate crystalline properties, such as particle scattering,
	optical spectroscopy and transport measurements, then follow. The
	final chapters are devoted to the study of electronic magnetism,
	cooperative magnetic effects and superconductivity. The book features:
	Coverage of a wide range of topics Tutorial style - simple and self-contained
	Proofs accompany all relevant statements Examples apply fundamental
	principles to current research The book will appeal primarily to
	senior undergraduate and postgraduate students, as well as researchers
	in theoretical and experimental solid state physics. The book will
	also be useful to those studying materials science, physical chemistry
	and electronic engineering. Both well-known figures in the scientific
	community, the authors have devoted their professional careers to
	solid state research and teaching. Grosso and Pastori Parravicini
	have authored numerous articles on the electronic and optical properties
	of crystals, exciton resonances, the Jahn-Teller effect, layered
	crystals and superlattices, disordered and incommensurate systems,
	and polymers. They also have extensive experience of teaching solid
	state physics to senior undergraduates and postgraduates at the
	Universities of Pavia and Pisa. \\ Synopsis \\ Although there are
	many books published in solid state physics, there is a wide gap
	between the active field of research and the concepts traditionally
	taught in solid state courses. This book fills that gap. The style
	is tutorial, simple, and completely self-contained. Solid State
	Physicsexplains to readers the newest advances in the area of condensed
	matter physics with rigorous, but lucid mathematics. Examples are
	an integral part of the text, and they are carefully designed to
	apply the fundamental principles illustrated in the text to currently
	active topics of research.},

	calculations of conductances through monatomic Na wires, taking
	into account the sharp tip geometry and discrete atomic structure
	of electrodes. We find that conductances ($G$) depend on the number
	($L$) of atoms in the wires; $G$ is $G_0(= 2e2/h)$ for odd L, independent
	of the wire geometry, while $G$ is generally smaller than $G_0$
	and sensitive to the wire structure for even L. This even-odd behavior
	is attributed to the charge neutrality and resonant character due
	to the sharp tip structure. We suggest that similar even-odd behavior
	may appear in other monovalent atomic wires.}

	the role of intershell interactions and the resistance associated

	is used to describe finite double-wall nanotubes [(10,10)@(5,5)]
	connected to two semi-infinite metallic leads. The current-voltage
	characteristics are calculated from the multichannel Landauer formula.
	When contact is made to the outer shell the calculations show that
	the current is distributed over both coaxial NT's but the overall
	resistance is independent if the inner tube is present or not. A
	device in which the leads are contacted to different coaxial shells
	of the MWNT (telescopic junction) is also investigated. The resistance
	of this system depends crucially on the extent of delocalization
	of the wave functions over several NT's.}

	has acquired new urgency with the advent of techniques for the fabrication
	of semiconductor structures in the nanometer range. For the restricted
	problem of tunneling in a scattering configuration, a coherent picture
	is now emerging. The dwell time $\tau_D$ has the status of an exact
	statement of the time spent in a region of space, averaged over
	all incoming particles. The phase times $\tau^\phi_T$ and $\tau^\phi_R$
	are defined separately for transmitted and reflected particles.
	They are asymptotic statements on completed scattering events and
	include self-interference delays as well as the time spent in the
	barrier. Consequently, neither the dwell time nor the phase times
	can answer the question of how much time a transmitted (alternatively,
	reflected) particle spent in the barrier region.}

	(golden rule approximation). We include the effect of an applied

	We predict a current collapse and strong negative differential conductance
	due to a ``blocking'' state when the electrode is coupled to the
	para-position of benzene. In contrast, for coupling to the meta-position,
	a series of steps in the I?V curve is found.},

	in a uniform magnetic field is constructed from the tight-binding
	form of a Bloch band by replacing $\hbar k $ by the operator $(p-eA
	)/ c$. The resultant Schr�dinger equation becomes a finite-difference
	equation whose eigenvalues can be computed by a matrix method. The
	magnetic flux which passes through a lattice cell, divided by a
	flux quantum, yields a dimensionless parameter whose rationality
	or irrationality highly influences the nature of the computed spectrum.
	The graph of the spectrum over a wide range of ``rational'' fields
	is plotted. A recursive structure is discovered in the graph, which
	enables a number of theorems to be proven, bearing particularly
	on the question of continuity. The recursive structure is not unlike
	that predicted by Azbel', using a continued fraction for the dimensionless
	parameter. An iterative algorithm for deriving the clustering pattern
	of the magnetic subbands is given, which follows from the recursive
	structure. From this algorithm, the nature of the spectrum at an
	``irrational'' field can be deduced; it is seen to be an uncountable
	but measure-zero set of points (a Cantor set). Despite these-features,
	it is shown that the graph is continuous as the magnetic field varies.
	It is also shown how a spectrum with simplified properties can be
	derived from the rigorously derived spectrum, by introducing a spread
	in the field values. This spectrum satisfies all the intuitively
	desirable properties of a spectrum. The spectrum here presented
	is shown to agree with that predicted by A. Rauh in a completely
	different model for crystal electrons in a magnetic field. A new
	type of magnetic ``superlattice'' is introduced, constructed so
	that its unit cell intercepts precisely one quantum of flux. It
	is shown that this cell represents the periodicity of solutions
	of the difference equation. It is also shown how this superlattice
	allows the determination of the wave function at nonlattice sites.
	Evidence is offered that the wave functions belonging to irrational
	fields are everywhere defined and are continuous in this model,
	whereas those belonging to rational fields are only defined on a
	discrete set of points. A method for investigating these predictions
	experimentally is sketched.}

	from ATP hydrolysis into mechanical work, which powers cell motility.
	Over the last ten years, single-molecule techniques and structural
	studies have led to rapid progess in understanding how these biological
	motors operate. How do they move? How do they generate force? How
	much fuel do they consume, and with what efficiency? Mechanics of
	Motor Proteins and the Cytoskeleton brings these new findings together.
	This book is for biology, physics, and engineering students who
	want to learn about the principles of protein mechanics and how
	it applies to the morphology and motility of cells. [...]},

  abstract = {Molecular motors are protein machines whose directed movement along
	cytoskeletal filaments is driven by ATP hydrolysis. Eukaryotic cells
	contain motors that help to transport organelles to their correct
	cellular locations and to establish and alter cellular morphology
	during cell locomotion and division. The best-studied motors, myosin
	from skeletal muscle and conventional kinesin from brain, are remarkably
	similar in structure, yet have very different functions. These differences
	can be understood in terms of the 'duty ratio', the fraction of
	the time that a motor Is attached to its filament. Differences in
	duty ratio can explain the diversity of structures, speeds and oligomerization
	states of members of the large kinesin, myosin and dynein families
	of motors.}

	severely limit transistor conductance in the 'ON' state, and reduce
	the current delivery capabilitya key determinant of device performance.
	Here we show that contacting semiconducting single-walled nanotubes
	by palladium, a noble metal with high work function and good wetting
	interactions with nanotubes, greatly reduces or eliminates the barriers
	for transport through the valence band of nanotubes. In situ modification
	of the electrode work function by hydrogen is carried out to shed

	states of semiconducting nanotubes can behave like ohmically contacted
	ballistic metallic tubes, exhibiting room-temperature conductance
	near the ballistic transport limit of 4e2/h (refs 46), high current-carrying
	capability (25 �A per tube), and FabryPerot interferences5 at
	low temperatures. Under high voltage operation, the current saturation
	appears to be set by backscattering of the charge carriers by optical

	flux, the interaction parameter g can be determined experimentally.
	For a finite ring the minimum conductance is strongly influenced

	orthogonality catastrophe is suppressed and the valley current is
	unexpectedly large.}

	phenomena within open-boundary time-dependent density functional
	theory. Within this approach all the response properties of a system
	are determined from the time propagation of the set of ``occupied''
	Kohn-Sham orbitals under the influence of the external bias. This
	central idea is combined with an open-boundary description of the
	geometry of the system that is divided into three regions: left/right
	leads and the device region (``real simulation region''). We have
	derived a general scheme to extract the set of initial states in
	the device region that will be propagated in time with proper transparent
	boundary-condition at the device/lead interface. This is possible
	due to a new modified Crank-Nicholson algorithm that allows an efficient
	time-propagation of open quantum systems. We illustrate the method
	in one-dimensional model systems as a first step towards a full
	first-principles implementation. In particular we show how a stationary
	current develops in the system independent of the transient-current
	history upon application of the bias. The present work is ideally
	suited to study ac transport and photon-induced charge-injection.
	Although the implementation has been done assuming clamped ions,
	we discuss how it can be extended to include dissipation due to
	electron-phonon coupling through the combined simulation of the
	electron-ion dynamics as well as electron-electron correlations.},

	Electron transfer is perhaps the single most important physical
	event in chemical, electrochemical, photochemical, biochemical,
	and biophysical processes. The focus and ubiquity of electron transfer
	is intriguing and exciting but a coherent and comprehensive approach
	to this topic is at the same time a challenge. Electron Transfer
	in Chemistry and Biology provides a thorough and didactic approach
	to the theoretical basis of electron transfer phenomena. Not only
	does it offer a full introduction to this area and a discussion
	of its historical development, it also gives detailed explanations
	of difficult issues, for example, long-range electron transfers,
	stochastic and dynamic processes, and biological features. A wide
	variety of readers will find this volume of great interest, ranging
	from final year undergraduate students, postgraduate students and
	university lecturers, to research staff in numerous fields including
	medical companies, electronics industry, catalysis research and
	development, chemical industry and some hospitals.}

	There is an algorithm to construct all energy eigenvalues and eigenfunctions

  abstract = {Based on the B{\"u}ttiker dephasing model, we propose an analytical
	scattering matrix approach to the long-range electron transfer phenomena.
	The present efficient scheme smoothly interpolates between the superexchange
	and the sequential hopping mechanisms. Various properties such as
	the drastic dephasing-assisted enhancement and turnover behaviors
	are demonstrated in good agreement with those obtained via the dynamical
	reduced density-matrix methods. These properties are further elucidated
	as results of the interplay among the dephasing strength, the tunneling
	parameter, and the bridge length of the electron transfer system.}

	of n-alkanes shows that the electron decay rate, beta(N), is strongly
	affected by the nature of the connections to the molecule, beta(N)
	being small and decreasing with applied bias. Mechanical (non-bonded)
	contacts result in beta(N) increasing with bias, an outcome completely
	inconsistent with tunneling theory. The degree to which theory and
	experiment diverge even for such simple molecular electronic components
	is illustrated by the observation of contact charging in alkanethiol
	monolayers. We speculate that standard tunneling theory does not

	the dot; in this limit our approach yields classical rate equations,
	which are solved numerically for a wide range of parameters. The
	other regime is that of low temperatures and weak electron-phonon
	coupling where a perturbative approximation in the Keldysh formulation
	can be applied. The interplay between the phonon-induced renormalization
	of the density of states on the quantum dot and the phonon-induced
	renormalization of the dot-lead coupling is found to be important.
	Whether or not the phonons are able to equilibrate in a time rapid
	compared to the transit time of an electron through the dot is found
	to affect the conductance. Observable signatures of phonon equilibration
	are presented. We also discuss the nature of the low-T to high-T

	two electron-accepting orbitals which interact with an intramolecular

	and non-equilibrium vibration-assisted tunneling under the following
	assumptions: (i) The Coulomb charging effect restricts the number
	of extra electrons to one. (ii) The orbitals are non-degenerate
	and couple asymmetrically to the vibration. (iii) The tunneling
	induces a non-equilibrium vibrational distribution; we compare with
	the opposite limit of strong relaxation of the vibration due to
	some dissipative environment. We find that a non-equilibrium feedback
	mechanism in the tunneling transitions generates strong negative
	differential conductance (NDC) in the model with two competing orbitals,
	whereas in a one-orbital model it leads only to weak NDC. In addition,
	we find another mechanism leading to weak NDC over a broader range
	of applied voltages. This pervasive effect is completely robust
	against strong relaxation of the vibrational energy. Importantly,
	the modulation of the electronic transport is based on an intramolecular
	asymmetry. We show that one can infer a non-equilibrium vibrational
	distribution when finding NDC under distinct gate- and bias-voltage
	conditions. In contrast, we demonstrate that any NDC effect in the

	through a C$_{60}$ molecule sandwiched between a metal surface and
	a metal (scanning tunnelling microscope) tip. By simulating compression
	of C$_{60}$ we have interpreted an experimental study of the variation
	of the conductance through a C$_{60}$ molecule with an applied external
	pressure. We found that the observed increase in conductance cannot
	be explained in terms of the changes in the electronic structure
	of the C$_{60}$ molecule alone. Effects related to the metal/molecule
	contact, i.e. the strength of the metal/C$_{60}$ interaction and
	the shape of the molecular orbitals in the tip, are in fact more
	important for the conductance. In view of this we discuss the importance
	of interference effects in the tip/molecule coupling.}

  abstract = {As the size of modern electronic and optoelectronic devices is scaling
	down at a steady pace, atomistic simulations become necessary for
	an accurate modelling of their structural, electronic, optical and
	transport properties. Such microscopic approaches are important
	in order to account correctly for quantum-mechanical phenomena affecting
	both electronic and transport properties of nanodevices. Effective
	bulk parameters cannot be used for the description of the electronic
	states since interfacial properties play a crucial role and semiclassical
	methods for transport calculations are not suitable at the typical
	scales where the device behaviour is characterized by coherent tunnelling.
	Quantum-mechanical computations with atomic resolution can be achieved
	using localized basis sets for the description of the system Hamiltonian.
	Such methods have been extensively used to predict optical and electronic
	properties of molecules and mesoscopic systems. The most important
	approaches formulated in terms of localized basis sets, from empirical
	tight-binding (TB) to first principles methods, are here reviewed.
	Being a full band approach, even the simplest TB overcomes the limitations
	of envelope function approximations, such as the well-known k �
	p, and allows to retain atomic details and realistic band structures.
	First principles calculations, on the other hand, can give a very
	accurate description of the electronic and structural properties.
	Transport in nanoscale devices cannot neglect quantum effects such
	as coherent tunnelling. In this context, localized basis sets are
	well-suited for the formal treatment of quantum transport since
	they provide a simple mathematical framework to treat open-boundary
	conditions, typically encountered when the system eigenstates carry
	a steady-state current. We review the principal methods used to
	formulate quantum transport based on local orbital sets via transfer
	matrix and Green's function (GF) techniques. We start from a general
	introduction to the scattering theory which leads to the Landauer
	formula, and then report on the most recent progresses of the field
	including the application of the self-consistent non-equilibrium
	GF formalism.}

  abstract = {In the present work we investigate the influence of molecular vibrations
	on the tunneling of electrons through a molecule sandwiched between
	two metal contacts. The study is confined to the elastic scattering
	only, but beyond the harmonic approximation. The problem is tackled
	both from a classical and a quantum-mechanical point of view. The
	classical approach consists in the computation of the time-dependent
	current fluctuations along the step of a molecular-dynamics (MD)
	simulation. On the other hand, the vibrational modes are treated
	quantum mechanically and the tunneling current is computed as an
	ensemble average over the distribution of the atomic configurations
	obtained by a suitable approximation of the density matrix for the
	normal-mode oscillators. We show that the lattice fluctuations modify
	the electron transmission. However, the answers obtained with the
	two methods are different. At low temperatures, the quantum-mechanical
	treatment is necessary in order to correctly include the zero-point
	fluctuations. For temperatures higher than a few hundred kelvin
	the simple harmonic approximation which leads to the phonon modes
	breaks down because the oscillation amplitudes of the lowest-energy
	modes become very large. In this regime beyond the harmonic approximation,
	higher-order terms should be considered leading to phonon-phonon
	interactions and classical MD simulations prove to be simpler and
	give better results.},

	$\mu$$<$0 ), and may therefore measure the kind and strength of
	correlation. Other recently proposed purely quantum-kinematical
	measures of the correlation strength arise from the small-separation
	behaviour of the pair density or - for fermions - from the non-idempotency
	of the momentum distribution and its large-momenta behaviour. They

  abstract = {Carbon nanotubes are exceptionally interesting from a fundamental
	research point of view. Many concepts of one-dimensional physics
	have been verified experimentally such as electron and phonon confinement
	or the one-dimensional singularities in the density of states; other
	1D signatures are still under debate, such as Luttinger-liquid behavior.
	Carbon nanotubes are chemically stable, mechanically very strong,
	and conduct electricity. For this reason, they open up new perspectives
	for various applications, such as nano-transistors in circuits,
	field-emission displays, artificial muscles, or added reinforcements
	in alloys. This text is an introduction to the physical concepts
	needed for investigating carbon nanotubes and other one-dimensional
	solid-state systems. Written for a wide scientific readership, each
	chapter consists of an instructive approach to the topic and sustainable
	ideas for solutions. The former is generally comprehensible for
	physicists and chemists, while the latter enable the reader to work
	towards the state of the art in that area. The book gives for the
	first time a combined theoretical and experimental description of
	topics like luminescence of carbon nanotubes, Raman scattering,
	or transport measurements. The theoretical concepts discussed range
	from the tight-binding approximation, which can be followed by pencil
	and paper, to first-principles simulations. We emphasize a comprehensive
	theoretical and experimental understanding of carbon nanotubes including
	- general concepts for one-dimensional systems - an introduction
	to the symmetry of nanotubes - textbook models of nanotubes as narrow
	cylinders - a combination of ab-initio calculations and experiments
	- luminescence excitation spectroscopy linked to Raman spectroscopy
	- an introduction to the 1D-transport properties of nanotubes -
	effects of bundling on the electronic and vibrational properties
	and - resonance Raman scattering in nanotubes.}

	form a well-ordered SAM on gold(111) and that the oxime end-functionality
	inhibits the formation of ordered SAMs. Charge-stabilized gold nanocrystals
	attach to sulfide-terminated SAMs on gold(111) to form robust gold(111)
	\ oligo(cyclohexylidene) \ gold nanocrystal molecular junctions.
	We show that the nanocrystal \ water interface can be charged by
	electron transport through the molecular layer. (C) 2001 Published

	through a bridge of intervening A/T base pairs. Alternatively, the
	radical cation can reside on the bases of the A/T bridge, even though

	Using the contour deformation technique in the complex frequency

	of the Fast Fourier Transformation. In contrast to the imaginary
	frequency approach, this method gives direct access to dynamical

	Results for the electronic spectral density are shown which exhibit
	new fine structure within the elementary excitations and in particular
	the shadows of the Fermi surface, recently observed in high-$T_{\rm

	made up of left and right components and is of staircase type, terminating

	(the dot energy level) with a width of two times the tunnel coupling
	amplitude between two neighboring dots. The electronic charge in

	are treated with the local spin density or generalized gradient

	projected on a real-space grid, in order to calculate the Hartree
	and exchange-correlation potentials and matrix elements, with a
	number of operations that scales linearly with the size of the system.
	We use a modified energy functional, whose minimization produces
	orthogonal wavefunctions and the same energy and density as the
	Kohn-Sham energy functional, without the need for an explicit orthogonalization.
	Additionally, using localized Wannier-like electron wavefunctions
	allows the computation time and memory required to minimize the
	energy to also scale linearly with the size of the system. Forces
	and stresses are also calculated efficiently and accurately, thus
	allowing structural relaxation and molecular dynamics simulations.}

	could have the same rate (10(14) s(-1)) as the electron transfer.
	In base pair model systems, proton transfer rates up to 10(13) s(-1)

	bases were performed at the 3-21G(*) and 6-31G* levels to elucidate
	the origin of the 5'-GG-3' sequence specificity for the photocleavage
	of DNA in the presence of electron-accepting photosensitizers. Ionization
	potentials (IP) were estimated as Koopman's theorem values for 16
	sets of two stacked nucleobases and seven sets of stacked nucleobase
	pair systems in a B-form geometry. It was found that the GG/CC system
	is the lowest among the 10 possible stacked nucleobase pairs and
	that approximately 70% of the HOMO is localized on the 5'-G of 5'-GG-3'.
	These calculations indicate that the 5'-G of 5'-GG-3' is the most
	electron donating site in B DNA and suggest that one-electron transfer
	from DNA to an electron acceptor occurs most effectively at 5'-GG-3'
	sites which are fully consistent with the experimental data. In
	order to know the fate of the cation radical, the vertical IPs were
	estimated for seven stacked nucleobase pairs. It was found that
	the GG/CC system possesses the smallest vertical IP and that the
	cation radical is localized on the 5'-G of 5'-GG-3'. These results
	imply that the 5'-G of 5'-GG-3' is a sink in "hole" migration through
	DNA, i.e., an electron-loss center created in a B-form DNA will
	end up predominantly on the 5'-G of 5'-GG-3', and suggest that not
	only the base specificity for initial photoionization but also subsequent
	energetically favored hole migration to the lowest 5'-GG-3' site
	are the origin of the 5'-GG-3' specific cleavage. Calculations of
	stacked GGs with various geometries including orientations of A-
	and Z-form DNA were also examined.},

  abstract = {This paper outlines a design paradigm for molecular scale electronic
	systems. The contrast between the present bulk devices and potential
	molecular systems is presented along with the limitations of using
	bulk design philosophies for molecular-sized components. For example,
	the overwhelming considerations of heat dissipation on molecular
	scale electronic architectures are shown which demonstrate the need
	for dramatically different information transfer methods if these
	ultradense molecular devices are to be used for computation. The
	use of changes in electrostatic potential for information coding
	is suggested. The issue of signal restoration is addressed using
	a periodic external potential through the underlying substrate.

	electron transport in molecular junctions is presented. It is an
	extension to the inelastic case of the Green's function approach
	to the calculation of the conduction of such systems. The model
	is suited for the calculation in the off-resonance regime (where
	molecular levels are far from the Fermi energy) and in the low bias
	limit, a typical situation encountered in inelastic electron tunneling
	measurements. The presentation of a general model is followed by
	the introduction of several approximations that make the calculation
	feasible for many systems of interest. Ab initio calculations of
	the vibronic coupling that leads to inelastic contribution to the
	conductance are performed for several molecules (butadiene, biphenyl,
	dipyrrole, and dithiophene), representative of possible molecular
	wires. The role of inelastic conduction is then quantified without
	empirical parameters and the vibrational modes that dominate the
	process are identified. The situations where the inelastic mechanism
	is particularly relevant are considered. The limits of this approach

  pages = {054201},
  abstract = {The Kubo formula is used to get the scaling behavior of the static
	conductance distribution of wide wires showing pure nondiagonal
	disorder. Following recent works that point to unusual phenomena
	in some circumstances, scaling at the band center of wires of odd
	widths has been numerically investigated. While the mean conductance
	shows a decrease that is only proportional to the inverse square
	root of the wire length, the median of the distribution exponentially
	decreases as a function of the square root of the length. Actually,
	the whole distribution decays as the inverse square root of the
	length except close to G = 0 where the distribution accumulates
	the weight lost at larger conductances. It accurately follows the
	theoretical prediction once the free parameter is correctly fitted.
	Moreover, when the number of channels equals the wire length, but
	contacts are kept finite, the conductance distribution is still
	described by the previous model. It is shown that the common origin
	of this behavior is a simple Gaussian statistics followed, by the
	logarithm of the E = 0 wave function weight ratio of a system showing
	chiral symmetry. A finite value of the two-dimensional mean conductance
	is obtained in the infinite-size limit. Both conductance and wave
	function statistics distributions are given in this limit. These
	results are consistent with the critical character of the E = 0
	wave function predicted in the literature.},

	Graphite is found to be a semi-conductor with zero activation energy,
	i.e., there are no free electrons at zero temperature, but they
	are created at higher temperatures by excitation to a band contiguous
	to the highest one which is normally filled. The electrical conductivity
	is treated with assumptions about the mean free path. It is found
	to be about 100 times as great parallel to as across crystal planes.
	A large and anisotropic diamagnetic susceptibility is predicted
	for the conduction electrons; this is greatest for fields across
	the layers. The volume optical absorption is accounted for.}

	bracket the true EAs. Although the AEAs exhibit moderate fluctuations
	with respect to the choice of functional, systematic trends show
	that the covalent uracil (U) and thymine (T) anions are bound by
	0.05-0.25 eV while the adenine (A) anion is clearly unbound. The
	computed AEAs for cytosine (C) and guanine (G) oscillate between
	small positive and negative values for the three most reliable functional
	combinations (BP86, B3LYP, and BLYP), and it remains unclear if
	either covalent anion is bound. AEAs with B3LYP/TZ2P++ single points
	are 0.19 (U), 0.16 (T), 0.07 (G), -0.02 (C), and -0.17 eV (A). Favorable
	comparisons are made to experimental estimates extrapolated from
	photoelectron spectra data for the complexes of the nucleobases
	with water. However, experimental values scaled from liquid-phase
	reduction potentials are shown to overestimate the AEAs by as much
	as 1.5 eV. Because the uracil and thymine covalent EAs are in energy
	ranges near those of their dipole-bound counterparts, preparation
	and precise experimental measurement of the thermodynamically stable
	covalent anions may prove challenging.}

  abstract = {Biennial, interannual, and decadal signals in the Pacific basin are
	observed to share patterns and evolution in covarying sea surface
	temperature (SST), 18�C isotherm depth (Z18), zonal surface wind
	(ZSW), and wind stress curl (WSC) anomalies from 1955 to 1999. Each
	signal has warm SST anomalies propagating slowly eastward along
	the equator, generating westerly ZSW anomalies in their wake. These
	westerly ZSW anomalies produce cyclonic WSC anomalies off the equator
	which pump baroclinic Rossby waves in the western/central tropical
	North Pacific Ocean. These Rossby waves propagate westward, taking
	?6, ?12, and ?36 months to reach the western boundary near ?7�N,
	?12�N, and ?18�N on biennial, interannual, and decadal period
	scales, respectively. There, they reflect as equatorial coupled
	waves, propagating slowly eastward in covarying SST, Z18, and ZSW
	anomalies, taking ?6, ?12, and ?24 months to reach the central/eastern
	equatorial ocean. These equatorial coupled waves produce a delayed-negative
	feedback to the warm SST anomalies there. The decrease in Rossby
	wave phase speed with latitude, the increase in meridional scale
	of equatorial SST anomalies with period scale, and the associated
	increase in latitude of Rossby wave forcing are consistent with
	the delayed action oscillator (DAO) model used to explain El Ni�o.
	However, this is not true of the western-boundary reflection of
	Rossby waves into slow equatorial coupled waves. This requires modification
	of the extant DAO model. We construct a modified DAO model, demonstrating
	how the various mechanisms and the size and sources of their delays
	yield the resulting frequency of each signal.},

  abstract = {Exploring the use of individual molecules as active components in
	electronic devices has been at the forefront of nanoelectronics
	research in recent years. Compared to semiconductor microelectronics,
	modeling transport in single-molecule devices is much more difficult
	due to the necessity of including the effects of the device electronic

	level. Theoretical formulation of the problem therefore requires
	integrating the knowledge base in surface science, electronic structure
	theory, quantum transport, and device modeling into a single unified
	framework starting from the first principles. In this article, we
	introduce the theoretical framework for modeling single-molecule

	a self-consistent matrix Green's function method that combines nonequilibrium
	Green's function theory of quantum transport with atomic-scale description

	native DNA was performed in an ab initio scheme with a simulated
	aqueous solution environment by overlapping dimer approximation
	and negative factor counting method. The hopping conductivity was
	worked out by random walk theory and compared with recent experiment.
	We conclude that electronic transport in native DNA molecules should
	be caused by hopping among different bases as well as phosphates
	and sugar rings. Bloch type transport through the delocalized molecular
	orbitals on the whole molecular system also takes part in the electronic
	transport, but should be much weaker than hopping. The complementary
	strand of the double helix could raise the hopping conductivity
	for more than 2 orders of magnitudes, while the phosphate and sugar
	ring backbone could increase the hopping conductivity through the
	base stacks for about 1 order of magnitude. [...]}

	is briefly analyzed comparing the calculated line shapes of the
	I-V curves with recent experimental results. When the coupling to

	the combination of multiple Andreev processes and resonant transmission
	gives rise to a rich subgap structure which largely differs from
	the one found in the more studied S-N-S systems. We concentrate
	on this regime showing how multiple processes can be included within

	Because of the Dirac-like energy dispersion, a sharp localized resonance

	($\omega \ln \omega$ as $\omega \to 0$), is predicted for the impurity
	states. The same logarithmic dependence of self-energy and a linear

	the conduction electrons, characterizing a new universality class
	for the strong coupling fixed point. At the resonant energies, the

	via a molecular 'bridge' is a feature of many biological andchemical

	(DBA) systems is known to play a critical role in determining the
	ease of electron transfer,. In most DBA systems, the rate at which
	electron transfer occurs scales exponentially with the donor-acceptor
	distance - effectively the length of the bridge molecule. But theory
	predicts that regimes exist wherein the distance dependence may
	be very weak, the bridge molecules essentially acting as incoherent
	molecular wires. Here we show how these regimes can be accessed
	by molecular design. We have synthesized a series of structurally
	well-defined DBA molecules that incorporate tetracene as the donor
	and pyromellitimide as the acceptor, linked by p -phenylenevinylene
	oligomers of various lengths....}

abstract = {Charge transport (CT) through the DNA base pairs provides a means to promote redox reactions at a remote site and potentially to effect signaling between molecules bound to DNA. Here we describe the oxidation of a cell-cycle regulatory protein, p53, from a distance through DNA-mediated CT. A consensus p53 binding site as well as three DNA promoters regulated by p53 were synthesized containing a tethered DNA photooxidant, anthraquinone. Photoinduced oxidation of the protein occurs from a distance; introduction of an intervening CA mismatch, which inhibits DNA-mediated CT, prevents oxidation of p53. DNA-mediated oxidation is shown to promote dissociation of p53 from only some promoters, and this sequence-selectivity in oxidative dissociation correlates with the biological regulation of p53. Under severe oxidative stress, effected here through oxidation at long range, p53 dissociates from a promoter that activates DNA repair as well as the promoter for the negative regulator of p53, Mdm2, but not from a promoter activating cell-cycle arrest. Mass spectrometry results are consistent with disulfide bond formation in p53 upon DNA-mediated oxidation. Furthermore, DNA-bound p53 oxidation is shown in vivo by up-regulation of p53 and subsequent irradiation in the presence of a rhodium photooxidant to give a new p53 adduct that can be reversed with thiol treatment. This DNA-mediated oxidation of p53 parallels that seen by treating cells with hydrogen peroxide. These results indicate a unique mechanism using DNA-mediated CT chemistry by which p53 activity on different promoters may be controlled globally under conditions of oxidative stress.

Abstract = {{The optical exciton Aharonov-Bohm effect-i.e., an oscillatory component

   confinement of the electron, and high barrier for the hole, achieved,

   favorable for observing the optical exciton Aharonov-Bohm effect. The
   second derivative of the exciton energy with respect to the magnetic
   field is utilized to extract Aharonov-Bohm oscillations even for the
   lowest bright state unambiguously. A connection between the theories
   for infinitesimal narrow and finite width rings is established.
   Furthermore, the magnetization is compared to the persistent current,
   which oscillates periodically with the magnetic field and confirms thus
   the nontrivial (connected) topology of the wave function in the

Abstract = {{The electronic structure of radially polarized excitons in structured
   nanorings is analyzed, with emphasis in the ground-state properties and
   their dependence under applied magnetic fields perpendicular to the
   ring plane. The electron-hole Coulomb attraction has been treated
   rigorously, through numerical diagonalization of the full exciton
   Hamiltonian in the noninteracting electron-hole pairs basis. Depending
   on the relative weight of the kinetic energy and Coulomb contributions,
   the ground-state of polarized excitons has ``extended{''} or
   ``localized{''} features. In the first case, corresponding to small
   rings dominated by the kinetic energy, the ground-state shows
   Aharonov-Bohm (AB) oscillations due to the individual orbits of the
   building particles of the exciton. In the localized regime,
   corresponding to large rings dominated by the Coulomb interaction, the
   only remaining AB oscillations are due to the magnetic flux trapped
   between the electron and hole orbits. This dependence of the exciton, a
   neutral excitation, on the flux difference confirms this feature as a
   signature of Coulomb dominated polarized excitons. Analytical
   approximations are provided in both regimes, which accurately reproduce
   the numerical results.}},

   The spectra show discrete resonance lines, which reflect the quantized

Title = {{Optical response in a quantum dot superlattice nanoring under a lateral

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The optical absorption of a GaAs/AlGaAs quantum dot superlattice
   nanoring (QDSLNR) under a lateral dc electric field and with magnetic
   flux threading the ring is investigated. This structure and
   configuration provides a unique opportunity to study the optical
   response of a superlattice under an inhomogeneous electric field, which
   is not easily realized for general quantum well superlattices (QWSLs)
   but naturally realized for QDSLNRs under a homogeneous lateral electric
   field. It has been shown that a lateral dc electric field gives rise to
   a substantial change of the optical absorption spectra. Under a low
   field, the excitonic optical absorption is dominated by a 1s exciton.
   And with the electric field increasing, the optical absorption
   undergoes a transition from 1s excitonic absorption to 0 excitronic WSL
   absorption. (The number of 0, and -1 and +1 below are WSLs index.) The
   -1 and the +1 WSLs corresponding to the maximum effective field can
   also be identified. Due to the inhomogeneity of the electric field, the
   peaks of the -1 and the +1 WSLs are diminished and between them there
   exist rich and complicated structures. This is in contrast to the
   general QWSLs under a homogenous electric field. The complicated
   structures can be understood by considering the inhomogeneity of the
   electric field along the ring, which results in the nearest-neighbor
   transition, the next-nearest-neighbor transition, etc., have a
   different value repectively, at different sites along the ring. This
   may give rise to multiple WSLs. We have also shown that the line shape
   of the optical absorption is not sensitive to the threading magnetic
   flux. The threading magnetic flux only gives rise to a slight
   diamagnetic shift. Thus the enhancement of the sensitivity to the flux
   allowing for observation of the excitonic Aharanov-Bohm effect in the
   plain nanoring is not expected in QDSLNRs.}},

Abstract = {{We study the energy spectrum of magnons in a ferromagnet with

   which makes the Berry phase observable in some cases, similar to the
   Aharonov-Bohm effect for electrons. For example, it can be observed in
   the interference of spin waves propagating in mesoscopic rings. We
   discuss the effect of domain walls on the interference in ferromagnetic
   rings, and propose some experiments with a certain geometry of
   magnetization. We also show that the nonvanishing average topological

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{We use a plane-wave technique to study the electron and hole wave
   functions in self-assembled InGaAs quantum rings, investigating the
   influence on the electron-hole overlap of variations in the ring shape
   and composition profiles, and including the effects of built-in strain
   and the piezoelectric potential. Lateral variation of the ground-state
   electron and hole wave functions in a perfect ringlike structure is
   observed as a consequence of the piezoelectric potential, which has
   minima and maxima on the (110) and (1(1) over bar 0) planes passing
   through the center of the ring. We find for rings with reflection
   symmetry in the vertical direction that although the average electron
   and hole positions are equal, there is a significant vertical
   separation of the electron and hole peak probability densities in the
   (110) and (1(1) over bar 0) planes. A net vertical separation of the
   electron and hole may occur either through the piezoelectric potential
   when the (110) and (1(1) over bar 0) planes are no longer equivalent,
   or through strain effects when there is a shape or composition
   asymmetry in the {[}001] direction. Comparison of the theoretical
   predictions with experimental data confirm the presence of a large
   asymmetry in the ring profile both in the vertical direction, where the

   phase becomes more prominent as the transition point is approached,

Abstract = {{The quantum nature of matter lies in the wave function phases that
   accumulate while particles move along their trajectories. A prominent
   example is the Aharonov-Bohm phase, which has been studied in
   connection with the conductance of nanostructures. However, optical
   response in solids is determined by neutral excitations, for which no
   sensitivity to magnetic flux would be expected. We propose a mechanism
   for the topological phase of a neutral particle, a polarized exciton
   confined to a semiconductor quantum ring. We predict that this
   magnetic-field induced phase may strongly affect excitons in a system
   with cylindrical symmetry, resulting in switching between ``bright{''}
   exciton ground states and novel ``dark{''} states with nearly infinite
   lifetimes. Since excitons determine the optical response of
   semiconductors, the predicted phase can be used to tailor photon
   emission from quantum nanostructures.}},

Abstract = {{A theoretical study of an exciton confined in a quantum ring is

   investigated the evolution of the low-energy exciton spectrum with the

   the radiative transition probability from the exciton ground state at
   the expense of the decreasing probability of the transitions from the
   excited states. This effect results from the orthogonality properties
   of the exciton wavefunctions, which are specific to the quantum-ring

   the exciton spectrum, which can be used as a signature of the presence

Abstract = {{The magnetic field effects on excitons in an InAs nanoring are studied
   theoretically. By numerically diagonalizing the effective-mass
   Hamiltonian of the problem that can be separated into terms in
   center-of-mass and relative coordinates, we calculate the low-lying
   excitonic energy levels and oscillator strengths as a function of the
   ring width and the strength of an external magnetic field. It is shown
   that in the presence of Coulomb correlation, the so-called
   Aharonov-Bohm effect of excitons exists in a finite (but small) width
   nanoring. However, when the ring width becomes large, the
   non-simply-connected geometry of nanorings is destroyed, causing the
   suppression of the Aharonov-Bohm effect. The analytical results are
   obtained for a narrow-width nanoring in which the radial motion is the
   fastest one and adiabatically decoupled from the azimuthal motions. The
   conditional probability distribution calculated for the low-lying

Abstract = {{The coherent dynamics of magnetoexcitons in semiconductor nanorings
   following pulsed optical excitation is studied. The calculated temporal
   evolution of the excitonic dipole moment may be understood as a
   superposition of the relative motion of electrons and holes and a
   global circular motion associated with the magnetic-field splitting of
   these states. This dynamics of the electron-hole pairs can be generated
   either by local optical excitation of art ordered ring or,
   alternatively, by homogeneous: excitation of rings with broken
   rotational symmetry due to disorder or band tilting.}},

abstract = {The exceptional electronic properties of graphene, with its charge carriers mimicking relativistic quantum particles and its formidable potential in various applications, have ensured a rapid growth of interest in this new material. We report on electron transport in quantum dot devices carved entirely from graphene. At large sizes (>100 nanometers), they behave as conventional single-electron transistors, exhibiting periodic Coulomb blockade peaks. For quantum dots smaller than 100 nanometers, the peaks become strongly nonperiodic, indicating a major contribution of quantum confinement. Random peak spacing and its statistics are well described by the theory of chaotic neutrino billiards. Short constrictions of only a few nanometers in width remain conductive and reveal a confinement gap of up to 0.5 electron volt, demonstrating the possibility of molecular-scale electronics based on graphene.

 	structure. Here we demonstrate a simple and reliable method for
 	selectively removing single carbon shells from MWNTs and SWNT ropes
 	to tailor the properties of these composite nanotubes. We can remove
 	shells of MWNTs stepwise and individually characterize the different
 	shells. By choosing among the shells, we can convert a MWNT into
 	either a metallic or a semiconducting conductor, as well as directly
 	address the issue of multiple-shell transport. With SWNT ropes,
 	similar selectivity allows us to generate entire arrays of nanoscale
 	field-effect transistors based solely on the fraction of semiconducting
 	SWNTs.}

 	However, by moving the STM tip along the length of the nanotubes,
 	sharp deviations in the I-V characteristics could also be observed.
 	Well-defined positions were found at which the nanotube transport
 	current changed abruptly from a graphitic response to one that is
 	highly nonlinear and asymmetric, including near-perfect rectification.
 	This abrupt change in the nanotube transport suggests that the STM
 	tip had passed a region of the nanotube which acts less like a wire

 	on-tube nanodevices have been theoretically predicted for point

 	has a temperature independent subthreshold slope much larger than

 	prevent it from turning off abruptly. However, this disadvantage

 	Realistic long range Coulomb interaction strengths between bridge

Researchers have directed extensive experimental and theoretical efforts toward building functional optoelectronic devices using individual organic molecules and fabricating metal−molecule junctions. Although this method has many advantages, its limitations lead to large disagreement between experimental and theoretical results. This Account describes a new method to create molecular electronic devices, covalently bridging a gap in a single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNT) with an electrically functional molecule. First, we introduce a molecular-scale gap into a nanotube by precise oxidative cutting through a lithographic mask. Now functionalized with carboxylic acids, the ends of the cleaved carbon nanotubes are reconnected with conjugated diamines to give robust diamides. The molecular electronic devices prepared in this fashion can withstand and respond to large environmental changes based on the functional groups in the molecules. For example, with oligoanilines as the molecular bridge, the conductance of the device is sensitive to pH. Similarly, using diarylethylenes as the bridge provides devices that can reversibly switch between conjugated and nonconjugated states. The molecular bridge can perform the dual task of carrying electrical current and sensing/recognition through biological events such as protein/substrate binding and DNA hybridization. The devices based on DNA can measure the difference in electrical properties of complementary and mismatched strands. A well-matched duplex DNA 15-mer in the gap exhibits a 300-fold lower resistance than a duplex with a GT or CA mismatch. This system provides an ultrasensitive way to detect single-nucleotide polymorphisms at the individual molecule level. Restriction enzymes can cleave certain cDNA strands assembled between the SWNT electrodes; therefore, these strands maintain their native conformation when bridging the ends of the SWNTs. This methodology for creating novel molecular circuits forges both literal and figurative connections between chemistry, physics, materials science, and biology and promises a new generation of integrated multifunctional sensors and devices. }

 	representation of Kohn-Sham eigenstates and a superposition of optimized
 	neutral-atom potentials and related charge densities for constructing
 	the effective many-atom potential, all integrals are calculated
 	within DFT. Self-consistency is included at the level of Mulliken
 	charges rather than by self-consistently iterating electronic spin
 	densities and effective potentials. Excited-state properties are
 	accessible within the linear response approach to time-dependent
 	(TD) DFT. The coupling of electronic and ionic degrees of freedom
 	further allows us to follow the non-adiabatic structure evolution
 	via coupled electron-ion molecular dynamics in energetic particle
 	collisions and in the presence of ultrashort intense laser pulses.
 	We either briefly outline or give references describing examples
 	of applications to ground-state and excited-state properties. Addressing
 	the scaling problems in size and time generally and for biomolecular
 	systems in particular, we describe the implementation of the parallel
 	`divide-and-conquer' order-N method with DFTB and the coupling of
 	the DFTB approach as a quantum method with molecular mechanics force

 	it is possible to measure typical SPM magnitudes, such as, for example,
 	the tunnel current, the normal force and the amplitude or frequency
 	of the cantilever oscillation, as a function of any other two magnitudes
 	of the system: $f(x_1,x_2)$. In this paper we present different
 	examples of 3D modes. In particular, we have applied 3D modes to
 	the study of the electrostatic interaction of co-adsorbed single
 	walled carbon nanotubes and individual DNA molecules with a metallic
 	scanning force microscopy tip. The data indicate that adsorbed DNA
 	has a dielectric constant similar to that of the glass substrate.}

 	the charge transport to a GGG sequence by competing H$_2$O -trapping.
 	The efficiency of the charge transport diminished dramatically with
 	increasing number of A:T base pairs between G$^{+ \cdot}$ and GGG.

 	principles to current research advances. Grosso (University of Pisa)
 	and Parravicini (University of Pavia) begin by focusing on the electronic
 	structure of crystals--band theory, excitons and plasmons--and lattice
 	dynamics. Descriptions of methods used to investigate crystalline
 	properties, such as particle scattering, optical spectroscopy and
 	transport measurements, then follow. The final chapters are devoted
 	to the study of electronic magnetism, cooperative magnetic effects
 	and superconductivity.Copyright � 2004 Book News, Inc., Portland,
 	OR \\ Kurzbeschreibung \\ Solid State Physics bridges the gap between
 	fundamental principles and current research topics. Traditional
 	subjects, as well as the most recent advances, are covered in a
 	rigorous, but clear, mathematical style. With the only prerequisite
 	a working knowledge of wave mechanics, the reader is gently guided
 	through the subject and supplied with the tools which will allow
 	him or her to explore (without getting lost) the lively world of
 	current research. Solid State Physics is set to become the reference
 	work in this field.\\ Solid State Physics begins by focusing on
 	the electronic structure of crystals (band theory, excitons and
 	plasmons) and lattice dynamics. Descriptions of the methods used
 	to investigate crystalline properties, such as particle scattering,
 	optical spectroscopy and transport measurements, then follow. The
 	final chapters are devoted to the study of electronic magnetism,
 	cooperative magnetic effects and superconductivity. The book features:
 	Coverage of a wide range of topics Tutorial style - simple and self-contained
 	Proofs accompany all relevant statements Examples apply fundamental
 	principles to current research The book will appeal primarily to
 	senior undergraduate and postgraduate students, as well as researchers
 	in theoretical and experimental solid state physics. The book will
 	also be useful to those studying materials science, physical chemistry
 	and electronic engineering. Both well-known figures in the scientific
 	community, the authors have devoted their professional careers to
 	solid state research and teaching. Grosso and Pastori Parravicini
 	have authored numerous articles on the electronic and optical properties
 	of crystals, exciton resonances, the Jahn-Teller effect, layered
 	crystals and superlattices, disordered and incommensurate systems,
 	and polymers. They also have extensive experience of teaching solid
 	state physics to senior undergraduates and postgraduates at the
 	Universities of Pavia and Pisa. \\ Synopsis \\ Although there are
 	many books published in solid state physics, there is a wide gap
 	between the active field of research and the concepts traditionally
 	taught in solid state courses. This book fills that gap. The style
 	is tutorial, simple, and completely self-contained. Solid State
 	Physicsexplains to readers the newest advances in the area of condensed
 	matter physics with rigorous, but lucid mathematics. Examples are
 	an integral part of the text, and they are carefully designed to
 	apply the fundamental principles illustrated in the text to currently
 	active topics of research.},

 	calculations of conductances through monatomic Na wires, taking
 	into account the sharp tip geometry and discrete atomic structure
 	of electrodes. We find that conductances ($G$) depend on the number
 	($L$) of atoms in the wires; $G$ is $G_0(= 2e2/h)$ for odd L, independent
 	of the wire geometry, while $G$ is generally smaller than $G_0$
 	and sensitive to the wire structure for even L. This even-odd behavior
 	is attributed to the charge neutrality and resonant character due
 	to the sharp tip structure. We suggest that similar even-odd behavior
 	may appear in other monovalent atomic wires.}

 	is used to describe finite double-wall nanotubes [(10,10)@(5,5)]
 	connected to two semi-infinite metallic leads. The current-voltage
 	characteristics are calculated from the multichannel Landauer formula.
 	When contact is made to the outer shell the calculations show that

 	resistance is independent if the inner tube is present or not. A
 	device in which the leads are contacted to different coaxial shells

 	has acquired new urgency with the advent of techniques for the fabrication

 	problem of tunneling in a scattering configuration, a coherent picture
 	is now emerging. The dwell time $\tau_D$ has the status of an exact
 	statement of the time spent in a region of space, averaged over
 	all incoming particles. The phase times $\tau^\phi_T$ and $\tau^\phi_R$
 	are defined separately for transmitted and reflected particles.
 	They are asymptotic statements on completed scattering events and
 	include self-interference delays as well as the time spent in the
 	barrier. Consequently, neither the dwell time nor the phase times
 	can answer the question of how much time a transmitted (alternatively,
 	reflected) particle spent in the barrier region.}

 	efficiency of strand cleavage falls off exponentially with distance

 	in a uniform magnetic field is constructed from the tight-binding
 	form of a Bloch band by replacing $\hbar k $ by the operator $(p-eA
 	)/ c$. The resultant Schr�dinger equation becomes a finite-difference
 	equation whose eigenvalues can be computed by a matrix method. The
 	magnetic flux which passes through a lattice cell, divided by a
 	flux quantum, yields a dimensionless parameter whose rationality
 	or irrationality highly influences the nature of the computed spectrum.
 	The graph of the spectrum over a wide range of ``rational'' fields
 	is plotted. A recursive structure is discovered in the graph, which
 	enables a number of theorems to be proven, bearing particularly
 	on the question of continuity. The recursive structure is not unlike
 	that predicted by Azbel', using a continued fraction for the dimensionless
 	parameter. An iterative algorithm for deriving the clustering pattern
 	of the magnetic subbands is given, which follows from the recursive
 	structure. From this algorithm, the nature of the spectrum at an
 	``irrational'' field can be deduced; it is seen to be an uncountable
 	but measure-zero set of points (a Cantor set). Despite these-features,
 	it is shown that the graph is continuous as the magnetic field varies.
 	It is also shown how a spectrum with simplified properties can be
 	derived from the rigorously derived spectrum, by introducing a spread
 	in the field values. This spectrum satisfies all the intuitively
 	desirable properties of a spectrum. The spectrum here presented
 	is shown to agree with that predicted by A. Rauh in a completely
 	different model for crystal electrons in a magnetic field. A new
 	type of magnetic ``superlattice'' is introduced, constructed so
 	that its unit cell intercepts precisely one quantum of flux. It
 	is shown that this cell represents the periodicity of solutions
 	of the difference equation. It is also shown how this superlattice
 	allows the determination of the wave function at nonlattice sites.
 	Evidence is offered that the wave functions belonging to irrational
 	fields are everywhere defined and are continuous in this model,
 	whereas those belonging to rational fields are only defined on a
 	discrete set of points. A method for investigating these predictions
 	experimentally is sketched.}

 	barrier at the nanotubemetal junctions1-3. These energy barriers
 	severely limit transistor conductance in the 'ON' state, and reduce
 	the current delivery capabilitya key determinant of device performance.
 	Here we show that contacting semiconducting single-walled nanotubes
 	by palladium, a noble metal with high work function and good wetting
 	interactions with nanotubes, greatly reduces or eliminates the barriers
 	for transport through the valence band of nanotubes. In situ modification
 	of the electrode work function by hydrogen is carried out to shed
 	light on the nature of the contacts. With Pd contacts, the 'ON'
 	states of semiconducting nanotubes can behave like ohmically contacted
 	ballistic metallic tubes, exhibiting room-temperature conductance
 	near the ballistic transport limit of 4e2/h (refs 46), high current-carrying
 	capability (25 �A per tube), and FabryPerot interferences5 at
 	low temperatures. Under high voltage operation, the current saturation
 	appears to be set by backscattering of the charge carriers by optical
 	phonons. High-performance ballistic nanotube field-effect transistors
 	with zero or slightly negative Schottky barriers are thus realized.}

 	the quantum state space of the molecule. Current work in molecular
 	electronics usually addresses molecular junction transport, where
 	the molecule acts as a barrier for incoming electrons: This is the
 	fundamental Landauer idea of ``conduction as scattering'' generalized
 	to molecular junction structures. Another point of view in terms
 	of superexchange as a guiding mechanism for coherent electron transfer
 	through the molecular bridge is discussed. Molecules generally exhibit
 	relatively strong vibronic coupling. The last section of this overview
 	focuses on vibronic effects, including inelastic electron tunneling
 	spectroscopy, hysteresis in junction charge transport, and negative
 	differential resistance in molecular transport junctions.}

 	Kohn-Sham orbitals under the influence of the external bias. This
 	central idea is combined with an open-boundary description of the
 	geometry of the system that is divided into three regions: left/right
 	leads and the device region (``real simulation region''). We have
 	derived a general scheme to extract the set of initial states in
 	the device region that will be propagated in time with proper transparent
 	boundary-condition at the device/lead interface. This is possible
 	due to a new modified Crank-Nicholson algorithm that allows an efficient
 	time-propagation of open quantum systems. We illustrate the method
 	in one-dimensional model systems as a first step towards a full
 	first-principles implementation. In particular we show how a stationary
 	current develops in the system independent of the transient-current
 	history upon application of the bias. The present work is ideally
 	suited to study ac transport and photon-induced charge-injection.
 	Although the implementation has been done assuming clamped ions,
 	we discuss how it can be extended to include dissipation due to
 	electron-phonon coupling through the combined simulation of the
 	electron-ion dynamics as well as electron-electron correlations.},

 	Electron transfer is perhaps the single most important physical
 	event in chemical, electrochemical, photochemical, biochemical,
 	and biophysical processes. The focus and ubiquity of electron transfer
 	is intriguing and exciting but a coherent and comprehensive approach
 	to this topic is at the same time a challenge. Electron Transfer
 	in Chemistry and Biology provides a thorough and didactic approach
 	to the theoretical basis of electron transfer phenomena. Not only
 	does it offer a full introduction to this area and a discussion
 	of its historical development, it also gives detailed explanations
 	of difficult issues, for example, long-range electron transfers,
 	stochastic and dynamic processes, and biological features. A wide
 	variety of readers will find this volume of great interest, ranging
 	from final year undergraduate students, postgraduate students and
 	university lecturers, to research staff in numerous fields including
 	medical companies, electronics industry, catalysis research and
 	development, chemical industry and some hospitals.}

 	similar one leading to mean field theory. Applying this truncation
 	procedure to other 2D fermion models I obtain various simplified

   abstract = {Our understanding of oxidative damage to double helical DNA and the
 	design of DNA-based devices for molecular electronics is crucially
 	dependent upon elucidation of the mechanism and dynamics of electron
 	and hole transport in DNA. Electrons and holes can migrate from
 	the locus of formation to trap sites, and such migration can occur
 	through either a single-step ``superexchange'' mechanism or a multistep
 	charge transport ``hopping'' mechanism. The rates of single-step
 	charge separation and charge recombination processes are found to
 	decrease rapidly with increasing transfer distances, whereas multistep
 	hole transport processes are only weakly distance dependent. However,
 	the dynamics of hole transport has not yet been directly determined.

 	been created. Experiments on these devices have shown, for example,

 	Whether or not the phonons are able to equilibrate in a time rapid

 	to be inadequate for this problem. The localized states which may
 	occur are discussed. A simple expression for the chemisorption energy
 	$\Delta E$ is obtained, and a variational method is given for obtaining
 	its self-consistent value. The metal eigenfunctions enter $\Delta
 	E$ only through a function $\Delta ( \epsilon )$, and the foregoing
 	results are exemplified and applied when this function is semielliptical.
 	When the band is half-filled, a single analytic formula for the
 	one-electron part of $\Delta E$ is obtained, in accord with the
 	Kohn-Majumdar theorem. [...]}

 	two electron-accepting orbitals which interact with an intramolecular

 	and non-equilibrium vibration-assisted tunneling under the following
 	assumptions: (i) The Coulomb charging effect restricts the number
 	of extra electrons to one. (ii) The orbitals are non-degenerate
 	and couple asymmetrically to the vibration. (iii) The tunneling
 	induces a non-equilibrium vibrational distribution; we compare with
 	the opposite limit of strong relaxation of the vibration due to
 	some dissipative environment. We find that a non-equilibrium feedback
 	mechanism in the tunneling transitions generates strong negative
 	differential conductance (NDC) in the model with two competing orbitals,
 	whereas in a one-orbital model it leads only to weak NDC. In addition,
 	we find another mechanism leading to weak NDC over a broader range
 	of applied voltages. This pervasive effect is completely robust
 	against strong relaxation of the vibrational energy. Importantly,
 	the modulation of the electronic transport is based on an intramolecular
 	asymmetry. We show that one can infer a non-equilibrium vibrational
 	distribution when finding NDC under distinct gate- and bias-voltage
 	conditions. In contrast, we demonstrate that any NDC effect in the

 	semi-complementary strands of DNA. When a rhodium complex is tethered
 	to one of the arms of the four-way junction assembly, thereby restricting
 	its intercalation into the pi -stack, photo-induced oxidative damage
 	occurs to varying degrees at all guanine doublets in the assembly,
 	though direct strand scission only occurs at the predicted site
 	of intercalation. In studies where the Mg2+ concentration was varied,
 	so as to perturb base stacking at the junction, charge transport
 	was found to be enhanced but not to be strongly localized to the
 	arms that preferentially stack on each other. These data suggest
 	that the conformations of four-way junctions can be relatively mobile.
 	Certainly, in four-way junctions charge transport is less discriminate
 	than in the more rigidly stacked DNA double crossover assemblies.}

 	the potential to probe this prediction, as it can resolve simultaneously

 	an accurate modelling of their structural, electronic, optical and
 	transport properties. Such microscopic approaches are important
 	in order to account correctly for quantum-mechanical phenomena affecting
 	both electronic and transport properties of nanodevices. Effective
 	bulk parameters cannot be used for the description of the electronic
 	states since interfacial properties play a crucial role and semiclassical
 	methods for transport calculations are not suitable at the typical
 	scales where the device behaviour is characterized by coherent tunnelling.
 	Quantum-mechanical computations with atomic resolution can be achieved
 	using localized basis sets for the description of the system Hamiltonian.
 	Such methods have been extensively used to predict optical and electronic
 	properties of molecules and mesoscopic systems. The most important
 	approaches formulated in terms of localized basis sets, from empirical
 	tight-binding (TB) to first principles methods, are here reviewed.
 	Being a full band approach, even the simplest TB overcomes the limitations
 	of envelope function approximations, such as the well-known k �
 	p, and allows to retain atomic details and realistic band structures.
 	First principles calculations, on the other hand, can give a very
 	accurate description of the electronic and structural properties.
 	Transport in nanoscale devices cannot neglect quantum effects such
 	as coherent tunnelling. In this context, localized basis sets are
 	well-suited for the formal treatment of quantum transport since
 	they provide a simple mathematical framework to treat open-boundary
 	conditions, typically encountered when the system eigenstates carry
 	a steady-state current. We review the principal methods used to
 	formulate quantum transport based on local orbital sets via transfer
 	matrix and Green's function (GF) techniques. We start from a general
 	introduction to the scattering theory which leads to the Landauer
 	formula, and then report on the most recent progresses of the field
 	including the application of the self-consistent non-equilibrium
 	GF formalism.}

   abstract = {In the present work we investigate the influence of molecular vibrations
 	on the tunneling of electrons through a molecule sandwiched between
 	two metal contacts. The study is confined to the elastic scattering
 	only, but beyond the harmonic approximation. The problem is tackled
 	both from a classical and a quantum-mechanical point of view. The
 	classical approach consists in the computation of the time-dependent
 	current fluctuations along the step of a molecular-dynamics (MD)
 	simulation. On the other hand, the vibrational modes are treated
 	quantum mechanically and the tunneling current is computed as an
 	ensemble average over the distribution of the atomic configurations
 	obtained by a suitable approximation of the density matrix for the
 	normal-mode oscillators. We show that the lattice fluctuations modify
 	the electron transmission. However, the answers obtained with the
 	two methods are different. At low temperatures, the quantum-mechanical
 	treatment is necessary in order to correctly include the zero-point
 	fluctuations. For temperatures higher than a few hundred kelvin
 	the simple harmonic approximation which leads to the phonon modes
 	breaks down because the oscillation amplitudes of the lowest-energy
 	modes become very large. In this regime beyond the harmonic approximation,
 	higher-order terms should be considered leading to phonon-phonon
 	interactions and classical MD simulations prove to be simpler and
 	give better results.},

 	exhibit rich structures resulting from both resonant tunneling through

 	degeneracy lifting within the molecular orbitals, probably due to
 	the Jahn-Teller effect and local electric fields. Theoretical fits
 	account well for our experimental data.}

 	$\mu$$<$0 ), and may therefore measure the kind and strength of
 	correlation. Other recently proposed purely quantum-kinematical
 	measures of the correlation strength arise from the small-separation
 	behaviour of the pair density or - for fermions - from the non-idempotency

 	research point of view. Many concepts of one-dimensional physics
 	have been verified experimentally such as electron and phonon confinement
 	or the one-dimensional singularities in the density of states; other
 	1D signatures are still under debate, such as Luttinger-liquid behavior.
 	Carbon nanotubes are chemically stable, mechanically very strong,
 	and conduct electricity. For this reason, they open up new perspectives
 	for various applications, such as nano-transistors in circuits,
 	field-emission displays, artificial muscles, or added reinforcements
 	in alloys. This text is an introduction to the physical concepts
 	needed for investigating carbon nanotubes and other one-dimensional
 	solid-state systems. Written for a wide scientific readership, each
 	chapter consists of an instructive approach to the topic and sustainable
 	ideas for solutions. The former is generally comprehensible for
 	physicists and chemists, while the latter enable the reader to work
 	towards the state of the art in that area. The book gives for the
 	first time a combined theoretical and experimental description of
 	topics like luminescence of carbon nanotubes, Raman scattering,
 	or transport measurements. The theoretical concepts discussed range
 	from the tight-binding approximation, which can be followed by pencil
 	and paper, to first-principles simulations. We emphasize a comprehensive
 	theoretical and experimental understanding of carbon nanotubes including
 	- general concepts for one-dimensional systems - an introduction
 	to the symmetry of nanotubes - textbook models of nanotubes as narrow
 	cylinders - a combination of ab-initio calculations and experiments
 	- luminescence excitation spectroscopy linked to Raman spectroscopy
 	- an introduction to the 1D-transport properties of nanotubes -
 	effects of bundling on the electronic and vibrational properties
 	and - resonance Raman scattering in nanotubes.}

 	be engineered by an appropriate choice of molecules and anchoring
 	groups. Our results, obtained through a combination of state-of-the-art

 	the nonequilibrium Green's function formalism within the context

 	from the dc conductance displaying both capacitive and inductive

We have tested 80 base pairs of single- and double-stranded DNA (ssDNA and dsDNA, respectively) of complex base sequences. About a 2540 pA current (at 1 V) was measured for the dsDNA molecule covalently attached to the SWNT electrode at its termini. In the absence of base pair stacking, a ssDNA carries a feeble current of 1 pA or less. Gate-voltage-dependent IV characteristics revealed that the bridging dsDNA molecule acts as a p-type channel between SWNT source and drain electrodes. }

 	distances in duplex DNA by a series of relatively shortrange steps
 	(hops). The mechanism for the short-range migration is not clearly
 	understood. At one extreme, the radical cation is localized on guanines
 	(G) and undergoes a unistep migration to a distant G by superexchange
 	through a bridge of intervening A/T base pairs. Alternatively, the
 	radical cation can reside on the bases of the A/T bridge, even though
 	this appears to be prohibited by differences in oxidation potentials
 	measured for the isolated DNA bases. We report experiments on DNA
 	oligonucleotides in which GG steps are separated by (A/T), bridges
 	(n = 2-5) and a radical cation is introduced by irradiation of a
 	covalently linked anthraquinone derivative. Quantitative assessment
 	of the distance dependence of radical cation migration efficiency
 	shows that it is incompatible with a mechanism that requires hole
 	hopping exclusively by superexchange.}

 	is ignored. The retarded self-energy of any dot in the array is
 	made up of left and right components and is of staircase type, terminating

 	(the dot energy level) with a width of two times the tunnel coupling

   abstract = {Interstrand proton transfer, which is driven by the large changes
 	in acidity or basicity that result from loss or uptake of an electron
 	from or by a base in a base pair of DNA, can constitute a very powerful
 	stop to the migration of holes or electrons in the direction of
 	the DNA helix via the stacked bases. In theory, such a proton transfer
 	could have the same rate (10(14) s(-1)) as the electron transfer.
 	In base pair model systems, proton transfer rates up to 10(13) s(-1)
 	have been measured. As a result of the existence of proton transfer
 	barriers to electron transfer, the migration distance of the charge
 	carriers in DNA is likely to be short, extending over only less
 	than or equal to 5 bp's (17 Angstrom).}

 	bases were performed at the 3-21G(*) and 6-31G* levels to elucidate
 	the origin of the 5'-GG-3' sequence specificity for the photocleavage
 	of DNA in the presence of electron-accepting photosensitizers. Ionization
 	potentials (IP) were estimated as Koopman's theorem values for 16
 	sets of two stacked nucleobases and seven sets of stacked nucleobase
 	pair systems in a B-form geometry. It was found that the GG/CC system
 	is the lowest among the 10 possible stacked nucleobase pairs and
 	that approximately 70% of the HOMO is localized on the 5'-G of 5'-GG-3'.
 	These calculations indicate that the 5'-G of 5'-GG-3' is the most
 	electron donating site in B DNA and suggest that one-electron transfer
 	from DNA to an electron acceptor occurs most effectively at 5'-GG-3'
 	sites which are fully consistent with the experimental data. In
 	order to know the fate of the cation radical, the vertical IPs were
 	estimated for seven stacked nucleobase pairs. It was found that
 	the GG/CC system possesses the smallest vertical IP and that the
 	cation radical is localized on the 5'-G of 5'-GG-3'. These results
 	imply that the 5'-G of 5'-GG-3' is a sink in "hole" migration through
 	DNA, i.e., an electron-loss center created in a B-form DNA will
 	end up predominantly on the 5'-G of 5'-GG-3', and suggest that not
 	only the base specificity for initial photoionization but also subsequent
 	energetically favored hole migration to the lowest 5'-GG-3' site
 	are the origin of the 5'-GG-3' specific cleavage. Calculations of
 	stacked GGs with various geometries including orientations of A-
 	and Z-form DNA were also examined.},

 	a high-order structure is introduced in comparison with periodic

 	in which a ring consists of L components, which are themselves rings
 	consisting of L components, and so on. A lattice of multiply looped
 	rings when the number of hierarchies is greater than two is three
 	dimensional, as suggested by the existence of an Anderson transition,
 	in which a quantum particle runs through a random potential. The
 	Curie temperature of ferromagnetic transition and the critical strength
 	of electron-electron interaction in a Mott transition are demonstrated
 	to be well modulated by changing L in the hierarchical structure,

 	conductance distribution of wide wires showing pure nondiagonal
 	disorder. Following recent works that point to unusual phenomena
 	in some circumstances, scaling at the band center of wires of odd
 	widths has been numerically investigated. While the mean conductance
 	shows a decrease that is only proportional to the inverse square
 	root of the wire length, the median of the distribution exponentially
 	decreases as a function of the square root of the length. Actually,
 	the whole distribution decays as the inverse square root of the
 	length except close to G = 0 where the distribution accumulates
 	the weight lost at larger conductances. It accurately follows the
 	theoretical prediction once the free parameter is correctly fitted.
 	Moreover, when the number of channels equals the wire length, but
 	contacts are kept finite, the conductance distribution is still
 	described by the previous model. It is shown that the common origin
 	of this behavior is a simple Gaussian statistics followed, by the
 	logarithm of the E = 0 wave function weight ratio of a system showing
 	chiral symmetry. A finite value of the two-dimensional mean conductance
 	is obtained in the infinite-size limit. Both conductance and wave
 	function statistics distributions are given in this limit. These
 	results are consistent with the critical character of the E = 0
 	wave function predicted in the literature.},

 	for controlling macroscopic lubrication and adhesion, for comprehending
 	biological macromolecular interfaces, and for developing submicrometre-scale
 	electromechanical devices. An object undergoing lateral motion while
 	in contact with a second object can either roll or slide. The resulting
 	energy loss and mechanical wear depend largely on which mode of
 	motion occurs. At the macroscopic scale, rolling is preferred over
 	sliding, and it is expected to have an equally important role in
 	the microscopic domain. Although progress has been made in our understanding
 	of the dynamics of sliding at the atomic level, we have no comparable
 	insight into rolling owing to a lack of experimental data on microscopic
 	length scales. Here we produce controlled rolling of carbon nanotubes
 	on graphite surfaces using an atomic force microscope.}

 	that the covalent uracil (U) and thymine (T) anions are bound by
 	0.05-0.25 eV while the adenine (A) anion is clearly unbound. The
 	computed AEAs for cytosine (C) and guanine (G) oscillate between
 	small positive and negative values for the three most reliable functional
 	combinations (BP86, B3LYP, and BLYP), and it remains unclear if
 	either covalent anion is bound. AEAs with B3LYP/TZ2P++ single points
 	are 0.19 (U), 0.16 (T), 0.07 (G), -0.02 (C), and -0.17 eV (A). Favorable
 	comparisons are made to experimental estimates extrapolated from
 	photoelectron spectra data for the complexes of the nucleobases
 	with water. However, experimental values scaled from liquid-phase
 	reduction potentials are shown to overestimate the AEAs by as much
 	as 1.5 eV. Because the uracil and thymine covalent EAs are in energy
 	ranges near those of their dipole-bound counterparts, preparation
 	and precise experimental measurement of the thermodynamically stable
 	covalent anions may prove challenging.}

 	temperature (SST), 18�C isotherm depth (Z18), zonal surface wind
 	(ZSW), and wind stress curl (WSC) anomalies from 1955 to 1999. Each
 	signal has warm SST anomalies propagating slowly eastward along
 	the equator, generating westerly ZSW anomalies in their wake. These
 	westerly ZSW anomalies produce cyclonic WSC anomalies off the equator
 	which pump baroclinic Rossby waves in the western/central tropical
 	North Pacific Ocean. These Rossby waves propagate westward, taking
 	?6, ?12, and ?36 months to reach the western boundary near ?7�N,
 	?12�N, and ?18�N on biennial, interannual, and decadal period
 	scales, respectively. There, they reflect as equatorial coupled
 	waves, propagating slowly eastward in covarying SST, Z18, and ZSW
 	anomalies, taking ?6, ?12, and ?24 months to reach the central/eastern
 	equatorial ocean. These equatorial coupled waves produce a delayed-negative
 	feedback to the warm SST anomalies there. The decrease in Rossby
 	wave phase speed with latitude, the increase in meridional scale
 	of equatorial SST anomalies with period scale, and the associated
 	increase in latitude of Rossby wave forcing are consistent with
 	the delayed action oscillator (DAO) model used to explain El Ni�o.
 	However, this is not true of the western-boundary reflection of
 	Rossby waves into slow equatorial coupled waves. This requires modification
 	of the extant DAO model. We construct a modified DAO model, demonstrating
 	how the various mechanisms and the size and sources of their delays
 	yield the resulting frequency of each signal.},

 	by the complex cations (Fe(phen)(3)(2+), Ni(phen)(3)(2+), and Co(phen)(3)(3+))
 	than by the simple cations (Mg2+, Mn2+, Ni2+, Ca2+, Co3+). The mesh
 	height of the plasmid DNA network was higher when the complex cations
 	were added to DNA samples. The mesh size decreased with increasing

 	(DBA) systems is known to play a critical role in determining the
 	ease of electron transfer,. In most DBA systems, the rate at which
 	electron transfer occurs scales exponentially with the donor-acceptor
 	distance - effectively the length of the bridge molecule. But theory
 	predicts that regimes exist wherein the distance dependence may
 	be very weak, the bridge molecules essentially acting as incoherent
 	molecular wires. Here we show how these regimes can be accessed
 	by molecular design. We have synthesized a series of structurally
 	well-defined DBA molecules that incorporate tetracene as the donor
 	and pyromellitimide as the acceptor, linked by p -phenylenevinylene

 abstract = {Charge transport (CT) through the DNA base pairs provides a means to promote redox reactions at a remote site and potentially to effect signaling between molecules bound to DNA. Here we describe the oxidation of a cell-cycle regulatory protein, p53, from a distance through DNA-mediated CT. A consensus p53 binding site as well as three DNA promoters regulated by p53 were synthesized containing a tethered DNA photooxidant, anthraquinone. Photoinduced oxidation of the protein occurs from a distance; introduction of an intervening CA mismatch, which inhibits DNA-mediated CT, prevents oxidation of p53. DNA-mediated oxidation is shown to promote dissociation of p53 from only some promoters, and this sequence-selectivity in oxidative dissociation correlates with the biological regulation of p53. Under severe oxidative stress, effected here through oxidation at long range, p53 dissociates from a promoter that activates DNA repair as well as the promoter for the negative regulator of p53, Mdm2, but not from a promoter activating cell-cycle arrest. Mass spectrometry results are consistent with disulfide bond formation in p53 upon DNA-mediated oxidation. Furthermore, DNA-bound p53 oxidation is shown in vivo by up-regulation of p53 and subsequent irradiation in the presence of a rhodium photooxidant to give a new p53 adduct that can be reversed with thiol treatment. This DNA-mediated oxidation of p53 parallels that seen by treating cells with hydrogen peroxide. These results indicate a unique mechanism using DNA-mediated CT chemistry by which p53 activity on different promoters may be controlled globally under conditions of oxidative stress.

 Abstract = {{The optical exciton Aharonov-Bohm effect-i.e., an oscillatory component

    favorable for observing the optical exciton Aharonov-Bohm effect. The

    field is utilized to extract Aharonov-Bohm oscillations even for the
    lowest bright state unambiguously. A connection between the theories

    Furthermore, the magnetization is compared to the persistent current,
    which oscillates periodically with the magnetic field and confirms thus
    the nontrivial (connected) topology of the wave function in the

 Abstract = {{The electronic structure of radially polarized excitons in structured
    nanorings is analyzed, with emphasis in the ground-state properties and
    their dependence under applied magnetic fields perpendicular to the
    ring plane. The electron-hole Coulomb attraction has been treated
    rigorously, through numerical diagonalization of the full exciton
    Hamiltonian in the noninteracting electron-hole pairs basis. Depending
    on the relative weight of the kinetic energy and Coulomb contributions,
    the ground-state of polarized excitons has ``extended{''} or
    ``localized{''} features. In the first case, corresponding to small
    rings dominated by the kinetic energy, the ground-state shows
    Aharonov-Bohm (AB) oscillations due to the individual orbits of the
    building particles of the exciton. In the localized regime,
    corresponding to large rings dominated by the Coulomb interaction, the
    only remaining AB oscillations are due to the magnetic flux trapped
    between the electron and hole orbits. This dependence of the exciton, a
    neutral excitation, on the flux difference confirms this feature as a
    signature of Coulomb dominated polarized excitons. Analytical
    approximations are provided in both regimes, which accurately reproduce
    the numerical results.}},

    and a concentric double ring. For both samples, highly efficient
    photoluminescence emitted from a single quantum structure is detected.
    The spectra show discrete resonance lines, which reflect the quantized
    nature of the ring-type electronic states. In the concentric double
    ring, the carrier confinement in the inner ring and that in the outer

 Title = {{Optical response in a quantum dot superlattice nanoring under a lateral
    electric field}},
 Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},

 Month = {{OCT}},
 Abstract = {{The optical absorption of a GaAs/AlGaAs quantum dot superlattice
    nanoring (QDSLNR) under a lateral dc electric field and with magnetic
    flux threading the ring is investigated. This structure and
    configuration provides a unique opportunity to study the optical
    response of a superlattice under an inhomogeneous electric field, which
    is not easily realized for general quantum well superlattices (QWSLs)
    but naturally realized for QDSLNRs under a homogeneous lateral electric
    field. It has been shown that a lateral dc electric field gives rise to
    a substantial change of the optical absorption spectra. Under a low
    field, the excitonic optical absorption is dominated by a 1s exciton.
    And with the electric field increasing, the optical absorption
    undergoes a transition from 1s excitonic absorption to 0 excitronic WSL
    absorption. (The number of 0, and -1 and +1 below are WSLs index.) The
    -1 and the +1 WSLs corresponding to the maximum effective field can
    also be identified. Due to the inhomogeneity of the electric field, the
    peaks of the -1 and the +1 WSLs are diminished and between them there
    exist rich and complicated structures. This is in contrast to the
    general QWSLs under a homogenous electric field. The complicated
    structures can be understood by considering the inhomogeneity of the
    electric field along the ring, which results in the nearest-neighbor
    transition, the next-nearest-neighbor transition, etc., have a
    different value repectively, at different sites along the ring. This
    may give rise to multiple WSLs. We have also shown that the line shape
    of the optical absorption is not sensitive to the threading magnetic
    flux. The threading magnetic flux only gives rise to a slight
    diamagnetic shift. Thus the enhancement of the sensitivity to the flux
    allowing for observation of the excitonic Aharanov-Bohm effect in the
    plain nanoring is not expected in QDSLNRs.}},

 Abstract = {{We study the energy spectrum of magnons in a ferromagnet with
    topologically nontrivial magnetization profile. In the case of
    inhomogeneous magnetization corresponding to a metastable state of
    ferromagnet, the spin-wave equation of motion acquires a gauge
    potential leading to a Berry phase for the magnons propagating along a
    closed contour. The effect of magnetic anisotropy is crucial for the
    Berry phase: we show that the anisotropy suppresses its magnitude,
    which makes the Berry phase observable in some cases, similar to the
    Aharonov-Bohm effect for electrons. For example, it can be observed in
    the interference of spin waves propagating in mesoscopic rings. We
    discuss the effect of domain walls on the interference in ferromagnetic
    rings, and propose some experiments with a certain geometry of
    magnetization. We also show that the nonvanishing average topological
    field acts on the magnons like a uniform magnetic field on electrons.
    It leads to the quantization of the magnon spectrum in the topological

 Abstract = {{We use a plane-wave technique to study the electron and hole wave
    functions in self-assembled InGaAs quantum rings, investigating the
    influence on the electron-hole overlap of variations in the ring shape
    and composition profiles, and including the effects of built-in strain
    and the piezoelectric potential. Lateral variation of the ground-state
    electron and hole wave functions in a perfect ringlike structure is
    observed as a consequence of the piezoelectric potential, which has
    minima and maxima on the (110) and (1(1) over bar 0) planes passing
    through the center of the ring. We find for rings with reflection
    symmetry in the vertical direction that although the average electron
    and hole positions are equal, there is a significant vertical
    separation of the electron and hole peak probability densities in the
    (110) and (1(1) over bar 0) planes. A net vertical separation of the
    electron and hole may occur either through the piezoelectric potential
    when the (110) and (1(1) over bar 0) planes are no longer equivalent,
    or through strain effects when there is a shape or composition
    asymmetry in the {[}001] direction. Comparison of the theoretical
    predictions with experimental data confirm the presence of a large
    asymmetry in the ring profile both in the vertical direction, where the

    electric field in co-moving frame, which causes a superposition of
    opposite parity states, i.e., \textbackslash{}2s> and

    superposition gives rise to a nonvanishing electric dipole moment
    required for the DAC effect to the exciton. The accumulated phase is

    onto a two-dimensional classical Coulomb gas with spatially anisotropic
    interactions. controlled by the relative coupling capacitance. Such
    anisotropy. related with the action of excitonic particle-hole pairs,
    is found to suppress quantum fluctuations and to help establish
    superconductivity. similarly to the gate charge. The persistent current
    generated due to the magnetic field is observed to increase with the
    coupling capacitance. The increment in the side of the superconducting
    phase becomes more prominent as the transition point is approached,

    excitons were measured at 4.2 K as a function of the applied magnetic
    field (0-9 T). The emission energy shows a diamagnetic shift as well as
    a Zeeman splitting. We measured the emission of different charge states
    of the exciton in many individual dots, In a few of the measured rings,
    a new behavior was observed, namely a clear departure from the low

 Abstract = {{The quantum nature of matter lies in the wave function phases that
    accumulate while particles move along their trajectories. A prominent
    example is the Aharonov-Bohm phase, which has been studied in
    connection with the conductance of nanostructures. However, optical
    response in solids is determined by neutral excitations, for which no
    sensitivity to magnetic flux would be expected. We propose a mechanism
    for the topological phase of a neutral particle, a polarized exciton
    confined to a semiconductor quantum ring. We predict that this
    magnetic-field induced phase may strongly affect excitons in a system
    with cylindrical symmetry, resulting in switching between ``bright{''}
    exciton ground states and novel ``dark{''} states with nearly infinite
    lifetimes. Since excitons determine the optical response of
    semiconductors, the predicted phase can be used to tailor photon
    emission from quantum nanostructures.}},

 Abstract = {{A theoretical study of an exciton confined in a quantum ring is

    investigated the evolution of the low-energy exciton spectrum with the

    the radiative transition probability from the exciton ground state at
    the expense of the decreasing probability of the transitions from the
    excited states. This effect results from the orthogonality properties
    of the exciton wavefunctions, which are specific to the quantum-ring

 Abstract = {{The magnetic field effects on excitons in an InAs nanoring are studied
    theoretically. By numerically diagonalizing the effective-mass
    Hamiltonian of the problem that can be separated into terms in
    center-of-mass and relative coordinates, we calculate the low-lying
    excitonic energy levels and oscillator strengths as a function of the
    ring width and the strength of an external magnetic field. It is shown
    that in the presence of Coulomb correlation, the so-called
    Aharonov-Bohm effect of excitons exists in a finite (but small) width
    nanoring. However, when the ring width becomes large, the
    non-simply-connected geometry of nanorings is destroyed, causing the
    suppression of the Aharonov-Bohm effect. The analytical results are
    obtained for a narrow-width nanoring in which the radial motion is the
    fastest one and adiabatically decoupled from the azimuthal motions. The
    conditional probability distribution calculated for the low-lying
    excitonic states allows identification of the presence of the
    Aharonov-Bohm effect. The linear optical susceptibility is also
    calculated as a function of the magnetic field, to be compared with the

 Abstract = {{The coherent dynamics of magnetoexcitons in semiconductor nanorings
    following pulsed optical excitation is studied. The calculated temporal
    evolution of the excitonic dipole moment may be understood as a
    superposition of the relative motion of electrons and holes and a
    global circular motion associated with the magnetic-field splitting of
    these states. This dynamics of the electron-hole pairs can be generated
    either by local optical excitation of art ordered ring or,
    alternatively, by homogeneous: excitation of rings with broken
    rotational symmetry due to disorder or band tilting.}},

 abstract = {The exceptional electronic properties of graphene, with its charge carriers mimicking relativistic quantum particles and its formidable potential in various applications, have ensured a rapid growth of interest in this new material. We report on electron transport in quantum dot devices carved entirely from graphene. At large sizes (>100 nanometers), they behave as conventional single-electron transistors, exhibiting periodic Coulomb blockade peaks. For quantum dots smaller than 100 nanometers, the peaks become strongly nonperiodic, indicating a major contribution of quantum confinement. Random peak spacing and its statistics are well described by the theory of chaotic neutrino billiards. Short constrictions of only a few nanometers in width remain conductive and reveal a confinement gap of up to 0.5 electron volt, demonstrating the possibility of molecular-scale electronics based on graphene.

abstract = {Graphene is a wonder material with many superlatives to its name. It is the thinnest known material in the universe and the strongest ever measured. Its charge carriers exhibit giant intrinsic mobility, have zero effective mass, and can travel for micrometers without scattering at room temperature. Graphene can sustain current densities six orders of magnitude higher than that of copper, shows record thermal conductivity and stiffness, is impermeable to gases, and reconciles such conflicting qualities as brittleness and ductility. Electron transport in graphene is described by a Dirac-like equation, which allows the investigation of relativistic quantum phenomena in a benchtop experiment. This review analyzes recent trends in graphene research and applications, and attempts to identify future directions in which the field is likely to develop.

abstract = {Electronic states in disordered conductors on the verge of localization are predicted to exhibit critical spatial characteristics indicative of the proximity to a metal-insulator phase transition. We used scanning tunneling microscopy to visualize electronic states in Ga1-xMnxAs samples close to this transition. Our measurements show that doping-induced disorder produces strong spatial variations in the local tunneling conductance across a wide range of energies. Near the Fermi energy, where spectroscopic signatures of electron-electron interaction are the most prominent, the electronic states exhibit a diverging spatial correlation length. Power-law decay of the spatial correlations is accompanied by log-normal distributions of the local density of states and multifractal spatial characteristics.}

Our results confirm the recently predicted symmetry of the multifractal exponents. We have discovered that the result of multifractal analysis of the real data depends on the excitation scheme used in the experiment. }
